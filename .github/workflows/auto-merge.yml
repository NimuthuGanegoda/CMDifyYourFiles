# Auto-merge workflow intentionally disabled.
# 
# The previous configuration used `pascalgn/automerge-action` with the
# default GITHUB_TOKEN. Introducing automated merge behavior should be
# done in a separate, clearly documented PR with reviewed merge criteria
# and security considerations.
#
# This file is currently left without any active workflows.
